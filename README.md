# README #

This repository was created as part of a class to teach Django
and test some docker-compose features like entrypoints, volumes,
fully dockerized deployments and env files within the containers.

The docker-compose functionality was fully based on PyDanny's (awesome)
[Django Cookiecutter](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django), 
who I recommend anyone to check out to handle your projects or use as
reference to structure your own Django projects.
